            <h2>What is The Temperature?</h2>
            <p>"<strong>Temperature</strong> is a measure of how hot or cold something is; specifically, a 
                measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in an object, which is a 
                type of energy associated with motion. But how hot is hot, and how cold is cold? 
                The terms hot and cold are not very scientific terms. If we really want to specify 
                how hot or cold something is, we must use temperature. For instance, how hot is melted iron? 
                To answer that question, a physical scientist would measure the temperature of the liquid 
                metal. Using temperature instead of words, like hot or cold, reduces confusion."

            <h2>What is Celsius?</h2>
            <p>"<strong>Celsius</strong>, also called centigrade, scale based on 0° for the 
                freezing point of water and 100° for the boiling point of water. 
                Invented in 1742 by the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius, it is 
                sometimes called the centigrade scale because of the 100-degree 
                interval between the defined points. The Celsius scale is in 
                general use wherever the metric system of units has been 
                adopted, and it is used in scientific work everywhere."

            <h2>What is Fahrenheit?</h2>
            <p>"<strong> Fahrenheit temperature scale</strong>, scale based on 32° for the freezing 
                point of water and 212° for the boiling point of water, the interval between the two 
                being divided into 180 equal parts. The 18th-century German physicist 
                Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit originally took as the zero of his scale the temperature 
                of an equal ice-salt mixture and selected the values of 30° and 90° for the freezing 
                point of water and normal body temperature, respectively; these later were 
                revised to 32° and 96°, but the final scale required an adjustment to 98.6° for the 
                latter value."

            <h2>What is Kelvin?</h2>
            <p>"<strong>Kelvin (K)</strong>, base unit of thermodynamic temperature measurement in the International 
                System of Units (SI). The 2018 General Conference on Weights and Measures decided that 
                effective from May 20, 2019, the unit would be defined such that the Boltzmann constant 
                would be equal to 1.380649 × 10−23 joule per kelvin. This unit was originally defined 
                as 100/27,316 of the triple point (equilibrium among the solid, liquid, and gaseous 
                phases) of pure water. The kelvin is also the fundamental unit of the Kelvin scale, an 
                absolute temperature scale named for the British physicist 
                William Thomson (known as Lord Kelvin). An absolute temperature scale has as its zero 
                point absolute zero (−273.15° on the Celsius temperature scale and −459.67° on the 
                Fahrenheit temperature scale), the theoretical temperature at which the molecules of a 
                substance have the lowest energy; hence, all values on such a scale are nonnegative. 
                Many physical laws and formulas can be expressed more simply when an absolute 
                temperature scale is used; accordingly, the Kelvin scale has been adopted as the 
                international standard for scientific temperature measurement. The difference between 
                the freezing and boiling points of water is 100 degrees in both the 
                Kelvin and Celsius scales; thus, the Kelvin degree has the same magnitude as the 
                Celsius degree."
